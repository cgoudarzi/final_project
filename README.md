# final_project
For my Final Project I will be building an full-stack stack application out of Node.js that hosts a platform runner game centered around my band and our album.  The game is built using the Phaser.js HTML game framework.

Technologies include:
Node.js
LESS
Gulp.js
HTML/CSS
Phaser.js
mongoDB/Mongoose
Express/Handlebars
